                  Kanye West isn't just hanging around town with a mystery
                  blonde, he's also married to her -- they recently had a
                  private ceremony to celebrate their love. TMZ has learned.
                  Sources connected to the couple tell TMZ the woman is Bianca
                  Censori, she hails from Australia and she's worked as an
                  architectural designer at Yeezy for several years.

                  <br />
                  She's also been a brunette until switching things up to the
                  short blonde look we've recently seen. Our sources say Ye and
                  Bianca recently had some sort of wedding ceremony -- though
                  we're told it doesn't appear they've filed a marriage
                  certificate to make it legal.
